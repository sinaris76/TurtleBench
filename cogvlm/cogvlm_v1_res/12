To create the same shape in Python using the turtle library, you can use the following code:

```python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()
t.set_position(0, 0, 0)
t.set_radius(200)
t.draw_circle(200, 0, 0)
t.show()
```
This code sets the turtle's position to the center, sets its radius to 200, and then draws a circle with that radius.</s>
