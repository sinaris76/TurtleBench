To create the same shape in Python using the turtle library, you can use the following code:

```python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()
t.set_x(0)
t.set_y(0)
t.set_size(3, 2)
t.draw('rectangle', fill='white', width=2, align='center')
t.show()
```
This code sets the turtle's position to the center of the screen, sets its size to a 3x2 rectangle, and then draws a rectangle with a width of 2, filling it with white.</s>
