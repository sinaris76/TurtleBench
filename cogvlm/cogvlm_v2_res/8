To create the same shape in Python using the turtle library, you can use the following code:

```python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()
t.circle(2, radius=1, fill='black')
t.circle(2, radius=1, fill='white')
t.show()
```
This code creates two circles with a radius of 1, one filled with black and the other with white, resulting in the shape shown in the image.</s>
