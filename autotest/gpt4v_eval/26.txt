The two images you've provided both show three rectangles arranged in a sequence. While the number of rectangles and their arrangement is the same in both images, it's hard to tell if they are showing a similar pattern without additional context such as colors, fill patterns, or specific designs within the rectangles.

From a purely structural standpoint, both images depict a sequence of three rectangles in a row, so in that sense, they do exhibit a similar pattern of shapes. However, without more details, it's impossible to tell if they are meant to represent the same series of objects, like items, buttons, or other elements in a graphical user interface, or something else entirely.
