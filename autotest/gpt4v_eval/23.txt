The images you've provided appear to show geometric shapes. The first image shows a shape with a symmetric, jagged perimeter, somewhat reminiscent of a gear or possibly a simple snowflake silhouette. The second image shows a smaller, simpler geometric shape with indentations and protrusions, but with less complexity than the first.

While both shapes feature a series of protrusions and indentations and are somewhat similar in that they are center-symmetric, they are not exactly the same pattern. The first one is more complex and has more protrusions than the second one, which is smaller and simpler in design.

If these shapes are meant to represent something specific or if their similarity in pattern has a particular significance, it's not completely clear from the images alone. More context would be needed to determine if there's a deeper connection or similarity beyond their basic geometric properties.
