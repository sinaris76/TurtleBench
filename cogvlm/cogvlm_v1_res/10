To create the same shape in Python using the turtle library, you can use the following code:

```python
import turtle

t = turtle.turtle()
t.set_color('black')
t.draw(t.triangles(3, 120, 120))
t.show()
```
This code sets the turtle's color to black and uses the `triangles` function to draw three triangles with the specified sides and angles.</s>
