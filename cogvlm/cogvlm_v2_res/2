To create the same shape in Python using the turtle library, you can use the following code:

```python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()
t.set_color('black')
t.set_fillcolor('white')
t.set_stroke(0)
t.draw(4, 4, 4, 4)
t.show()
```
This code creates a turtle and sets its color to black, fill color to white, and stroke to 0. Then, it draws a square with the given dimensions.</s>
