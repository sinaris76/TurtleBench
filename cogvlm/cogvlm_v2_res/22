To create the same shape in Python using the turtle library, you can use the following code:

```python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()
t.set_color('black')
t.fill(t.polygon(9, 0, 0))
t.show()
```
This code sets the turtle's color to black and uses the `polygon` function to draw a nine-sided shape.</s>
