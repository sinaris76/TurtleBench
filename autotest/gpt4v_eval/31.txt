The two images depict two pairs of squares arranged in different configurations. The first image shows two squares that are positioned next to each other with their sides touching, forming an L-shape. The second image shows two squares aligned vertically on top of each other.

While both images consist of two squares each, their arrangements differâ€”the first image has the squares side by side, and the second has them stacked. If you are referring to the use of repeated geometric shapes, then yes, they both show a pattern involving squares. However, the overall patterns formed by the arrangement of the squares are different.
