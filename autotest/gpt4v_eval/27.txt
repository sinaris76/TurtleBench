Yes, both images show a similar pattern: a square and a circle are combined in such a way that the square is inscribed within the circle. In both cases, the circle touches all four sides of the square at the midpoint of the sides. The key difference between the two images is their orientation and the relative size of the shapes. In the first image, the square is quite large relative to the circle, while in the second image, the circle is relatively large compared to the square. Additionally, the visual presentation and line thickness vary between the two images.
