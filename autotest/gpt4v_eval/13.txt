The images you've provided both feature a circle with lines radiating out from the center, dividing the circle into sectors. The first image presents a circle neatly divided into eight equal sectors by four straight lines that intersect at the circle's center. The second image also depicts a circle with lines radiating out from the center; however, the lines appear to be more numerous and more irregularly spaced compared to the first image.

While both images share the concept of a radial pattern originating from the center of a circle, the precision and distribution of the lines differ. The first image has a pattern with regular and symmetrical divisions, whereas the second image has a pattern that is less structured and precise.

Therefore, while they share a common theme of radial symmetry, the execution in the second image is less uniform and more irregular.
