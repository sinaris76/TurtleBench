Yes, these two images exhibit a similar abstract pattern that involves geometric shapes. Specifically, both designs involve shapes resembling diamonds or rhombuses that are combined in a symmetry-based pattern. 

The first image shows a complex grid-like structure composed of overlapping squares and diamonds that form a symmetrical pattern across the horizontal and vertical axes.

The second image has a simpler and less dense arrangement, featuring interconnected geometric shapes (diamonds and triangles) that maintain the symmetry on a smaller scale. Although less complex, this second pattern seems to be a more stylized or minimalist interpretation of the same geometric concept shown in the first image.
