The images you provided both incorporate geometric shapes, but the patterns they form are different.

The first image features a shape that resembles an ice cream cone or a balloon, with a semicircle on top of a triangle. The semicircle and the triangle are separated by a straight line.

The second image includes a circle, a triangle, and a semicircle, but they are arranged differently. There is a triangle with a semicircle overlapping part of it, and another semicircle abutting the triangle from outside.

While both images use triangular and semicircular shapes, the arrangement and relationship between these shapes are not the same, which means they are not showing a similar pattern.
