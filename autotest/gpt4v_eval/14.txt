The two images you provided depict configurations of geometric shapes. Comparing them:

1. Both images feature squares, although the orientations and arrangements differ.
2. In the first image, there are three squares with one appearing to be a diamond due to its 45-degree rotation, and they intersect each other in a somewhat complex pattern.
3. In the second image, there is a sequence of two squares connected by a line, creating a simpler and more linear pattern compared to the first image.

Overall, while both images include squares, they are not showing a similar pattern. The first one has an overlapping, interconnected design, whereas the second has a sequential, non-overlapping arrangement.
