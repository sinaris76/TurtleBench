To create the same shape in Python using the turtle library, you can use the following code:

```python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()
t.set_color('black')
t.set_pen('black')
t.draw(t.triangle(150, 150, 90))
t.show()
```
This code sets the turtle's color and pen to black, then draws a triangle with the given dimensions.</s>
