a series of three and a half steps that look like a staircase viewed from the side. Starting from the top left, there is a short horizontal line that moves to the right, followed by a vertical line going downwards, forming the first step. This is followed by two more full steps, each consisting of a horizontal line followed by a vertical line. After the third step, there is a final horizontal line that represents the half step, without a subsequent vertical line descending from it.
