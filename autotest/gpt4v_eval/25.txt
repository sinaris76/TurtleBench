Yes, the two images are showing a similar pattern. They both consist of a series of equilateral triangles arranged in a linear sequence. The pattern is often referred to as a "zigzag" or "chevron" pattern. The main difference between the two images is the size and number of the triangles: the first image shows larger triangles and fewer repetitions, while the second image has smaller triangles with more repetitions.
