The images you provided show two geometric figures, each composed of a square and a triangle. The arrangement and orientation of these shapes are different in the two images, but the basic concept of a square connected to a triangle is consistent in both.

In the first image, the square and triangle are joined in a way that resembles a simplistic house or arrow shape, giving the impression of a three-dimensional object with the square as the front face and the triangle as the side extending into the distance.

In the second image, the square and triangle are joined at an edge with a bend, forming a more abstract shape that does not convey a simple three-dimensional object as directly as the first one.

Overall, while both images combine a square and a triangle, the patterns are not identical due to their different orientations and connections.
