To create the same shape in Python using the turtle library, you can use the following code:

```python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()
t.set_color('black')
t.draw(t.square(2))
t.show()
```
This code sets the turtle's color to black and then draws a square with a side length of 2 using the turtle's square function.</s>
