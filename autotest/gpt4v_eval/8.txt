The two images showcase geometric figures, but they present different patterns and structures.

The first image depicts a two-dimensional geometric figure that combines a square with four triangles to form a symmetrical star-like pattern. This appears to be an example of a common geometric figure, often used in mathematical illustrations and designs.

The second image contains a more complex, asymmetrical arrangement of lines and angles. It presents a step-like pattern with sharp turns and angles that give it a jagged appearance, as well as a small square with one corner extending downwards, creating a kind of "spiral staircase" effect.

Overall, the two images do not show a similar pattern due to the differences in symmetry, complexity, and the arrangement of shapes.
