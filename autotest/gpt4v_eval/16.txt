The images you've shared appear to be two different geometric line drawings.

The first image features a complex geometric figure that looks like a combination of various shapes such as triangles, pentagons, and quadrilaterals. It might represent a 2D representation of a 3D object like a polyhedron, with various lines suggesting edges and vertices. There is an illusion of depth in this image, suggesting a three-dimensional form.

The second image shows a geometric figure with triangles and quadrilaterals, which resembles a 3D object, possibly a corner of a polyhedron, with some lines representing diagonals slicing through the figure. It is a simpler form compared to the first image.

Despite the fact that both images contain geometric shapes and suggest three-dimensional forms, the patterns they are showing are not exactly similar. The first image is more complex and contains a larger number of shapes and lines that interact with one another in a more intricate fashion, while the second image is simpler and focuses on a smaller number of geometric components. However, both may be exploring aspects of geometric shapes and their potential 3D interpretations.
