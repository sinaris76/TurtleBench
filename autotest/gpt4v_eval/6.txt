The two images show similar patterns in that they both consist of triangles arranged in a symmetric manner.

In the first image, there are two triangles with their bases aligned, one pointing up and the other pointing down, forming a symmetric pattern horizontally. This creates a shape reminiscent of an hourglass or bowtie.

In the second image, you see a smaller triangle inside a larger triangle. The inner triangle is inverted relative to the outer triangle, creating a pattern of a triangle within a triangle that suggests a sense of symmetry both vertically and horizontally. This pattern could be described as a "star" or "kite" shape.

The common theme between the two patterns is the use of triangles and the symmetry in their arrangements. However, the precise layout and the way the triangles interact are different in each image.
