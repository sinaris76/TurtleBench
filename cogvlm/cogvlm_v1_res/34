To create the same shape in Python using the turtle library, you can use the following code:

```python
import turtle

t = turtle.pyplot()
t.plot(t.radius(1.5), t.radius(1.5), '-o')
t.show()
```
This code creates a circle with a radius of 1.5 and another circle with the same radius, connected by a straight line.</s>
