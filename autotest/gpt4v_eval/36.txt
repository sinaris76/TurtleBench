The images you provided both display a large circle adjacent to a smaller circle. However, the arrangement is different in each. In the first image, the smaller circle is separate from the larger one, and there is clear space between them. In the second image, the smaller circle overlaps with, or is tangent to, the larger circle. So, while both images feature a similar motif of one circle next to a smaller one, the specific configurations are not identical.
