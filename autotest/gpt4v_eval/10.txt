The two images depict a similar pattern consisting of a circle inscribed within a square. Despite the difference in size and possibly the thickness of the lines between the two images, the fundamental geometric relationship between the shapes is consistent: both show a circle that touches the square at the midpoint of each side, meaning the diameter of the circle is equal to the length of a side of the square.
