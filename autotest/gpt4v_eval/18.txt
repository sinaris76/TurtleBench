The two images you've provided both consist of geometric shapes, specifically triangles. However, their patterns are different.

The first image depicts a symmetrical arrangement of four triangles pointing towards a central point, creating a shape reminiscent of an hourglass or bowtie. The juxtaposition of the triangles creates a sense of balance and symmetry.

The second image shows two triangles, one above the other. The smaller triangle is positioned upside down and is centered above the base of the larger triangle. This creates a simple pattern of one triangle nested above another, unlike the fourfold symmetrical pattern of the first image.

While both patterns utilize triangles, the arrangement and overall design differ between the two images.
