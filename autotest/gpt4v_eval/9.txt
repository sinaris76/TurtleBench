The first image appears to be a vertical line with a semicircle attached to each side, creating a shape commonly known as a "double semicircle." The second image shows two separate semicircular arcs facing each other with a gap between them.

While both images feature semicircular shapes, the arrangement and context are different. The first image is a single, symmetrical figure, while the second image consists of two separate semicircular elements. Essentially, they share the characteristic of involving semicircles, but they present these elements in distinct patterns.
