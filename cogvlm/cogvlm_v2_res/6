To create the same shape in Python using the turtle library, you can use the following code:

```python
import turtle

t = turtle.pyplot()
t.plot(0, 0, 0, 0, '-o')
t.plot(0, 1, 0, 0, '-o')
t.plot(1, 0, 0, 0, '-o')
t.plot(1, 1, 0, 0, '-o')

t.show()
```
This code creates a simple plot with four points, which can be interpreted as a diamond or a kite shape.</s>
