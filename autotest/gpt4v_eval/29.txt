No, the two images are not showing a similar pattern. The first image depicts a large square with a diagonal line running from one corner to the opposite corner, effectively dividing the square into two triangles. The second image shows a small square without any diagonal line through it. Therefore, the patterns are not the same; the first one includes a diagonal bisector while the second one does not.
