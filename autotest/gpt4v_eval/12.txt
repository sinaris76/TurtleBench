The images you've provided both contain geometric shapes (triangles) within a square, but the patterns shown are different.

In the first image, there is a large square with a complex pattern of triangles inside. The triangles are arranged such that they do not cover the entire square, leaving some areas within the square unfilled.

In the second image, there is a smaller square also with a pattern of triangles inside. Unlike the first image, the triangles in the second one cover the entire square, forming an 'X' shape across the square.

So, while they both contain triangles within a square, the specific patterns and the way the triangles fill the square are not similar.
