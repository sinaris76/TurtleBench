To create the same shape in Python using the turtle library, you can use the following code:

```python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()
t.set_color('black')
t.draw(t.triangle(120, 60, 60))
t.show()
```
This code sets the turtle's color to black and draws a triangle with a base of 120 degrees and a height of 60 degrees.</s>
