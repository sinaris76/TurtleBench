Yes, both images display a similar pattern called the Sierpinski triangle or Sierpinski gasket. It's a fractal and attractive fixed set with the overall shape of an equilateral triangle, subdivided recursively into smaller equilateral triangles. 

In the first image, the pattern seems to be at the beginning stages of its construction. A larger equilateral triangle contains an inverted triangle that creates four smaller triangles, and the pattern continues within one of those.

The second image shows a more advanced stage of the pattern with several levels of recursively subdivided triangles. Each iteration adds smaller triangles within the previous level's triangles, filling out the fractal design more completely.
