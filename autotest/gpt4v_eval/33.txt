The two images you provided display geometric shapes with lines drawn within circles. 

In the first image, there are two overlapping circles with a series of lines that intersect at what appears to be equal angles, forming a symmetrical pattern that resembles a square and four triangles within each circle. This composition suggests a more complex pattern within the circles.

The second image shows a single circle divided by two perpendicular lines into four equal quadrants, creating a simpler, less intricate pattern compared to the first image.

While both images feature circles with lines drawn through them, the complexity and style of the patterns within the circles are different. The first image has a more complex overlapping pattern, while the second image consists of a simple division into quadrants.
