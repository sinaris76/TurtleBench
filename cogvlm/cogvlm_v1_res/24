To create the same shape in Python using the turtle library, you can use the following code:

```python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()
t.set_position(0, 0, 0)
t.set_heading(120)
t.set_speed(0)
t.draw(3, 60, 120)
t.show()
```
This code sets the turtle's position to the origin, sets its heading to 120 degrees (which is the same as the angle of the triangle), and then draws a triangle with a base of 3 units and a height of 60 units.</s>
