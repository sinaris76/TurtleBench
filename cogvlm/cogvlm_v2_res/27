To create the same shape in Python using the turtle library, you can use the following code:

```python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()
t.set_position(0, 0, 0)
t.set_size(4, 4)
t.set_color('black')
t.draw('x', 2, 2, 2)
t.show()
```
This code sets the turtle's position, size, and color to black, then draws a diagonal line from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of the screen.</s>
