To create the same shape in Python using the turtle library, you can use the following code:

```python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()
t.set_color('black')
t.draw(polygon(points=([(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 0)], fill='black'))
t.show()
```
This code sets the turtle's color to black and uses the `draw` method to draw a polygon with the given points.</s>
