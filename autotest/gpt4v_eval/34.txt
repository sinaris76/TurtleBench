The two images you've provided do not show similar patterns. 

The first image is a simple outline of a symmetrical cross or plus sign, with arms of equal length extending out from a central square. 

The second image is a vertical sequence of rectangles with alternating horizontal lines above them, creating a pattern that resembles a set of steps or a ziggurat-like structure.

These two patterns are different in terms of their geometry, layout, and the visual rhythm they suggest.
