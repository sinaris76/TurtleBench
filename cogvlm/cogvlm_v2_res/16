To create the same shape in Python using the turtle library, you can use the following code:

```python
t = turtle()
t.circle(2, 2, fill='black')
t.circle(2, 0, fill='black')
t.circle(2, -2, fill='black')
t.triangle(2, 0, 0, fill='black')
t.show()
```
This code creates a circle with a diameter of 2 inches, two smaller circles at the top and bottom, and a triangle at the center.</s>
