The two images show geometrical shapes arranged in a way that could be considered a pattern, but they are not showing an identical pattern. In both images, you have shapes that are touching or overlapping each other, but there are differences in the sizes of the shapes, their orientations, and how they are connected.

In the first image, you see a series of five-sided polygons or pentagons. Three of them are aligned next to each other horizontally and connected at their sides, with one additional pentagon resting on top of the middle one, essentially forming a sort of arrow or house-like structure pointing upwards.

In the second image, there are three hexagons (six-sided polygons) arranged in a similar structure to the first image but with the bottom hexagons slightly overlapping. Additionally, there are two diamonds or rhombuses placed in between the hexagons.

While both images feature geometric shapes arranged in a symmetrical order, their exact patterns, shapes, and the relationship between components differ.
