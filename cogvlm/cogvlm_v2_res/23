To create the same shape in Python using the turtle library, you can use the following code:

```python
import turtle

t = turtle.turtle()
t.draw(turtle.triangle(120, 60, 60))
t.draw(turtle.triangle(120, 30, 60))
t.show()
```
This code creates two equal triangles with a base of 120 and a height of 60.</s>
