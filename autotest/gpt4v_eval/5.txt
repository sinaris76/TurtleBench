The two images show arrangements of triangles, but the patterns are not identical. In the first image, there are three triangles oriented such that they form what appears to be a larger, upside-down triangle with a horizontal line below it, resembling a simplistic representation of a tree or perhaps an arrow. In the second image, there are five triangles forming a pattern where one triangle points upwards and is followed by two smaller triangles pointing downwards, one inside the other, and then this is mirrored below the initial upward-pointing triangle. Both patterns incorporate triangular shapes, but the configurations and the number of triangles used differ between the two images.
