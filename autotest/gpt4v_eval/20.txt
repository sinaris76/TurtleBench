Yes, the two images do show a similar pattern. Both images consist of straight lines intersecting at a central point, creating symmetrical shapes. The first image shows a more complex pattern with additional lines, creating a star-like shape with multiple layers. The second image depicts a simpler pattern with fewer lines, forming a basic star shape. Despite the differences in complexity, the central concept of symmetrical lines radiating from a center point is consistent between the two.
